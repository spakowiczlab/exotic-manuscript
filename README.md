"Exogenous reads within Tissue with Immune Cells"

This is the tool created to process RNAseq samples heavily dominated by human reads for the identification of exogenous sequences. 

These data are accessible to the Spakowicz lab under an honest broker agreement with The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center - James. Sequencing data and select clinical data will be made available in a controlled database at the time of publication.
